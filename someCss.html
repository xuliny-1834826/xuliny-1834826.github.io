        <h2>Rabindranath Tagore</h2>
            <p>"Rabindranath Tagore was an Indian polymath- poet, writer, composer, philosopher and painter from Bengal. He reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse" of Gitanjali, he became in 1913 the first non-European as well as the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He is sometimes referred to as 'the Bard of Bengal'".</p>
            <p>"Let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves."</p>
            <p>"Sorrow is hushed into peace in my heart like the evening among the silent trees."</p>

        <h2>William Shakespeare</h2>
            <p2>"William Shakespeare was an English playwright, poet, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. They also continue to be studied and reinterpreted".</p2>
